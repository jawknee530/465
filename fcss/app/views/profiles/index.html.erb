After you have signed up for an account your name will be
listed below. Click the link at the bottom to create a new
profile which will allow you to add a description to 
your self. Once the profile has been created you will be
able to view it by clicking a link to the right of your name.
In this profile view you will be able to see who you have
been assigned. Others can view your profile but will not be
able to see who you were assigned unless they are logged in
with your user account. 
Once I debug a few more things on your profile page you will
have a drop down box where you can select other users that you 
do not with to be matched with for whatever reason (it better
be real).
