  If you do not appear in the table below select "Sign Up"
above and create a new user account.
  After you have signed up for an account your name will be
listed below. Click the link at the bottom to edit your
profile which will allow you to add a description to 
your self as well as add your address etc. Once the profile 
has been set up you will be able to view it by clicking a link
to the right of your name.
  In this profile view you will be able to see who you have
been assigned once the sign up deadline is reached. Other
users can view your profile but will not be able to see who 
you were assigned unless they are logged in with your user
account. 
  Vote/argue for wether you want users to be able to choose others
to not be matched with in the "Exclude" field of your profile.
(I think that signifigant others should be excluded but whatever.)
  Sign ups will be open until the day before thanksgiving at
which point everyone will be assigned a match and it will
show up on your profile page.
  Users profile pages will also show where the user will be
on xmas day so you can check your targets profile to figure out
what to do with/where to send their "gift". It may be a good 
idea to put in an address where you know your present will be 
recoverable and not where you are currently living (Dan).
